Kata source: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRange

The initial commit to this repo represents my attempt to solve this kata using TDD with a 30 minute time limit.
I was given 5 minutes to review the kata description prior to starting.

The goal is to accept a string representing a numeric range that may have an inclusive or exclusive start and
end range value. The kata was used to practice TDD, so testing was part of the development effort.

In the 30 minute period I was able to complete:

  - Input validation
  - Sequence (GetAllPoints)
  - ContainsRange (named Contains)
  - Equality check

Due to time constraints I didn't complete the following functionality:

  - Contains (checking if individual numbers existed in a range)
  - Overlaps

Enjoy!
